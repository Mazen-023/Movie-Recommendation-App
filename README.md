# Let's build our first Full-Stack project

This project aims to develop an interactive app that offers users movie recommendations based on genres, trends, and preferences. The app will be built using React to create a user-friendly interface, incorporating features such as search, genre-based filters, year-based filters, rating-based filters, and pagination for browsing movies. Additionally, the app will integrate a public movie API (e.g., The Movie Database API) to fetch real-time movie data. Redux will be used for state management.
