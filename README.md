# Build and Deploy movie recommendation app with React & Redux

<h1>Let's <span style="color:blu; font-weight:bold;">build</span> our first Full-Stack project</h1>

This project aims to develop an interactive app that offers users movie recommendations based on genres, trends, and preferences. The app will be built using React to create a user-friendly interface, incorporating features such as search, genre-based filters, year-based filters, rating-based filters, and pagination for browsing movies. Additionally, the app will integrate a public movie API (e.g., The Movie Database API) to fetch real-time movie data. Redux will be used for state management.
